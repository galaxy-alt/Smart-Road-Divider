# Smart-Road-Divider
Abstract of this project 
This project proposes a Adaptive Urban Lane Management system integrated with Smart City infrastructure to address real-time urban traffic congestion and ensure uninterrupted emergency vehicle passage. The system leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, including IR sensors, cloud analytics, and wireless communication modules, to dynamically reconfigure road lanes based on live traffic density. Unlike static dividers, this system enables adaptive lane allocation by shifting the divider according to real-time data, optimizing road capacity during peak hours. Traffic data is collected continuously and uploaded to cloud platforms like Blynk, facilitating centralized monitoring and predictive analytics for smart city dashboards. Additionally, a dedicated RF communication channel allows the system to detect approaching ambulances and automatically clear their path by overriding traffic signals, significantly reducing emergency response time. This IoT-based solution not only enhances commuter efficiency and safety but also aligns with the broader goals of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and sustainable urban mobility under smart city initiatives
